speed
up
the
modernization
of
its
military
to
fend
off

dangerous
times
The

The

Over
the
past
two

the
most
sweeping
changes
to

an
effort
to
create
a
fighting
force
that
can
win
modern
wars
The
modernization
drive
which

focused
on
expanding
air
and
naval
reach
is
challenging
more
than

the
Western
Pacific
